 <p><strong>Legend:</strong></p>
<p>This website is designed to resemble a terminal window, commonly used for interacting with computer systems via text commands.</p>
<p>Here's what the commands mean:</p>
<span>&#37; cat</span> - Display file contents (display information)
<span>&#37; cd</span> - Change directory (hyperlinks to that page)
<span>&#37; cd ..</span> - Change directory to the parent folder (back button)
