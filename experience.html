  <p><strong>Here you can find an overview of my hands-on experience in the field, including key technical roles and contributions.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>2024</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Coherent Corp.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Controls/Electronics Engineer (Internship)</strong></p>
<img src="Images/CoherentLogo.jpg" alt="Project 1 Image">
<p>  During my internship at Coherent Corp., I played a key role in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of control systems.
  
  I resolved control system faults through recalibration and hardware troubleshooting, which significantly improved equipment reliability.

  I optimized Allen Bradley PLC programming, leading to a 5% reduction in optical fiber wastage.

  Additionally, I installed chemical sensors on Nextrom lathes to enhance process monitoring and safety.
  
  I also conducted safety audits on control cabinets, identifying critical issues that contributed to safer maintenance practices.</p>

  <p><strong>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, UMass Chapter</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Liaison (Active)</strong></p>
<img src="Images/UmassIEEE.jpg" alt="Project 1 Image">
<p>  As the elected Liaison for the UMass IEEE Chapter, I facilitated communication between various engineering societies on campus. 
  
  My role involved coordinating with the executive board to plan events and initiatives that promoted professional development and networking opportunities for members.
  
  I also represented the IEEE chapter, actively promoting membership and engagement within the engineering community.</p>

  <p><strong>2023</strong></p>
  <p><strong>American Society of Mechanical Engineers, UMass Chapter</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Electronics Co-Lead of Student Design Team (Active)</strong></p>
<img src="Images/UMassASME.jpg" alt="Project 1 Image">
<p>  During my time on the UMass ASME Student Design Team, I co-led the implementation of embedded systems for a mini golf robot project, which was part of the 2024 ASME Student Design Competition.
  
  I utilized troubleshooting and debugging skills to ensure successful testing and prototyping, and employed I2C for precise motor control via an Xbox controller using Bluetooth.
  
  Collaborating with a matrixed team, I worked to enhance the robot's functionality, contributing to the team's top-8 finish overall, with a 5th place ranking in the initial round.</p>
